                                The Customer must register an Account with Macrohealthplus in order to use the Services. Macrohealthplus may assist the Customer in the registration procedures or can even create the account and profiles on behalf of the Customer, if requested, and send the link to verify the account by email.

The Customer has the obligation to check and eventually correct any inaccurate information. The Customer acknowledges that the account is personal or proprietary to the Customer or their practice and that they are expected to treat the account as confidential. The Customer agrees to provide accurate, current and complete information about the practice and Customer’s credentials as prompted by the registration and profile forms. <br />
